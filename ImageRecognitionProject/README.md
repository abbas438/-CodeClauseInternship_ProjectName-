# Image Recognition using OpenCV

This is a basic image recognition project created as part of my internship in the Artificial Intelligence domain at CodeClause.

The program identifies whether a given image is of a car or a dog by comparing it with a small dataset of training images. It uses simple image processing techniques including grayscale conversion, image resizing, and distance-based matching.

## Features

- Classifies input image as either "car" or "dog"
- Grayscale conversion and resizing of images
- Comparison using Euclidean distance
- Displays result and shows the input image
